        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          While SharePoint lists aren't technically relational databases, with the right approach, you can implement parent-child relationships and create connected data structures that work remarkably well in Power Apps. This capability lets you build more sophisticated apps without needing SQL Server or Dataverse licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this guide, I'll show you how to structure, connect, and manage related data across SharePoint lists. We'll build a simple but practical example: an issue tracking system where each issue can have multiple related actions.

        </div>
        
        <h2>Understanding the Approach</h2>
        <p>
          To create relationships between SharePoint lists, we'll use a classic database technique: adding a foreign key column that references the primary key of another table. In SharePoint terms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The automatically generated ID column in SharePoint lists serves as our primary key</li>
          <li>We'll add a custom number column in the "child" list to store the ID of the related "parent" record</li>
          <li>In Power Apps, we'll use this relationship to filter and create related records</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This creates a one-to-many relationship, where one record in the parent list can relate to many records in the child list.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Step 1: Setting Up the SharePoint Lists</h2>
        <p>
          We'll start by creating two SharePoint lists to store our data:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Issues List</strong>: The parent list that stores the main issues</li>
          <li><strong>Actions List</strong>: The child list that stores actions related to each issue</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Here's how to structure each list:
        </p>
        
        <CodeBlock code={createListsCode} language="SharePoint" />
        
        <p>
          The key to our implementation is the <strong>IssueId</strong> column in the Actions list. This number column will store the ID of the related issue, creating our parent-child relationship.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Important Notes About SharePoint IDs</h3>
        <p>
          SharePoint automatically creates an ID column for every list:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>IDs are unique within each list and increment automatically</li>
          <li>The ID column isn't shown in the default view, but you can add it</li>
          <li>IDs are not reused, even after items are deleted (similar to database identity columns)</li>
          <li>IDs are always of type Number, making them efficient for filtering and relationships</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Step 2: Connecting to SharePoint in Power Apps</h2>
        <p>
          Now, let's create a Power App and connect it to our SharePoint lists:
        </p>
        
        <CodeBlock code={dataConnectionCode} language="SharePoint" />
        
        <p>
          After connecting, you'll have access to both the Issues and Actions lists within your app, including all their columns.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Step 3: Building the Basic App Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Our app will need several screens:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Main Screen</strong>: Shows a gallery of Issues</li>
          <li><strong>New Issue Screen</strong>: Form to create a new Issue</li>
          <li><strong>View Issue Screen</strong>: Shows Issue details and related Actions</li>
          <li><strong>New Action Screen</strong>: Form to create a new Action related to the current Issue</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For the main screen, create a gallery connected to the Issues list. Add a plus button to navigate to the New Issue screen, and an edit icon in each item to navigate to the View Issue screen.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Main Screen Example</h3>
        <p>
          On your main screen:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Add a gallery connected to the Issues list (Gallery_Issues)</li>
          <li>Display the Title and ID in each gallery item</li>
          <li>Add a button that navigates to the New Issue screen</li>
          <li>Add an icon in each gallery item that navigates to the View Issue screen and selects the current item</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Step 4: Creating the Issue Detail Screen</h2>
        <p>
          The Issue detail screen is where the parent-child relationship becomes visible. This screen should show:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The details of the selected Issue</li>
          <li>A gallery of related Actions</li>
          <li>A button to add a new Action for this Issue</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The key is filtering the Actions gallery to show only Actions related to the current Issue:
        </p>
        
        <CodeBlock code={filteringCode} language="SharePoint" />
        
        <p>
          This filter checks the IssueId column in the Actions list and only shows records where it matches the ID of the currently selected Issue.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Step 5: Creating Related Records</h2>
        <p>
          When creating a new Action, we need to save both the Action details and its relationship to the parent Issue:
        </p>
        
        <CodeBlock code={savingChildRecordsCode} language="SharePoint" />
        
        <p>
          This Patch function saves a new record to the Actions list and sets the IssueId field to the ID of the currently selected Issue, creating the relationship between them.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
        
        <h3>Delegation Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          When working with SharePoint lists in Power Apps, delegation is an important concept to understand. Delegation determines whether operations happen at the data source or in the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is that filtering by ID and IssueId (both number fields) is fully delegable to SharePoint, meaning SharePoint will handle the filtering server-side. This ensures you'll get correct results even with large lists.
        </p>
        <p>
          For best performance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always filter using delegable operations when possible (=, &lt;, &gt;)</li>
          <li>Use number fields for relationships as they're fully delegable</li>
          <li>Consider using the Sort function to organize your data (also delegable)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Creating One-to-Many-to-Many Relationships</h3>
        <p>
          You can extend this pattern to create deeper relationships. For example, you could add a Comments list related to Actions, where each Action can have multiple Comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          To implement this, you would:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a Comments list with an ActionId column</li>
          <li>Filter the Comments gallery based on the selected Action</li>
          <li>When saving a Comment, set its ActionId to the selected Action's ID</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Cascading Deletes</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike true relational databases, SharePoint doesn't support automatic cascading deletes. If you delete a parent record, the related child records will remain orphaned.
        </p>
        <p>
          If cascading deletes are important for your app, you'll need to implement them manually:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Before deleting a parent record, find all related child records</li>
          <li>Delete the child records using Remove() or ForAll() with Remove()</li>
          <li>Then delete the parent record</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Real-World Application</h2>
        <p>
          This pattern can be applied to many real-world scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project Management</strong>: Projects and Tasks</li>
          <li><strong>Customer Service</strong>: Cases and Notes</li>
          <li><strong>Inventory Management</strong>: Products and Stock Levels</li>
          <li><strong>Event Planning</strong>: Events and Attendees</li>
          <li><strong>HR Processes</strong>: Employees and Training Records</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The pattern remains the same: create a column in the child list that references the ID of the parent record, then use filtering in Power Apps to show only the related records.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Limitations and Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          While this approach works well for many scenarios, it does have some limitations compared to true relational databases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No referential integrity (orphaned records possible)</li>
          <li>No cascading operations (must be implemented manually)</li>
          <li>No joins (relationships must be managed through filtering)</li>
          <li>Performance can degrade with very large lists (&gt;5000 items)</li>
          <li>Complex queries across multiple relationships may hit delegation limits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For complex enterprise applications with many relationships and large data volumes, you might want to consider Dataverse or a SQL Server database instead.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          SharePoint lists can indeed be used effectively as a relational database for Power Apps. By creating linked lists with appropriate columns to establish relationships, you can build sophisticated multi-table applications without needing additional licenses or more complex database platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach is perfect for departmental apps, team tools, and solutions where simplicity and accessibility are priorities. The ability to create, view, and manage related records gives your users a cohesive experience while leveraging the familiar and accessible SharePoint environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these techniques, you can build powerful, data-driven applications that feel like they're connected to a full relational database, all while staying within the SharePoint and Power Apps ecosystem.
